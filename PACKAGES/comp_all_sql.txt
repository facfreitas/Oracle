This script was posted by to the list and I found it very useful:


rem ***************************************************************
rem * file: comp_all.sql  created: 06/10/96    by: Robert Cordingley
rem * purpose: compile all database stored objects. 
rem * to use:  log in using a the appropriate account then execute
rem *          this script using the following syntax:
rem *
rem *            SQL> @comp_all
rem *
rem * NOTE:    You should not have to run this script more than
rem *          once since it uses the order_object_by_dependency
rem *          table to compile objects in the proper order.  Any
rem *          compilation errors generated should be investigated.
