Value 	Description
Auto_Fix 	Links a user entry in the sysusers table in the current database to a login of the same name in sysxlogins. You should check the result from the Auto_Fix statement to confirm that the correct link is in fact made. Avoid using Auto_Fix in security-sensitive situations.

When using Auto_Fix, you must specify user and password; login must be NULL. user must be a valid user in the current database.
Report 	Lists the users and corresponding security identifiers (SID) in the current database that are not linked to any login.

user, login, and password must be NULL or not specified.
Update_One 	Links the specified user in the current database to login. login must already exist. user and login must be specified. password must be NULL or not specified.

[@UserNamePattern =] 'user'

Is the name of a SQL Server user in the current database. user is sysname, with a default of NULL.

[@LoginName =] 'login'

Is the name of a SQL Server login. login is sysname, with a default of NULL.

[@Password =] 'password'

Is the password assigned to a new SQL Server login created by Auto_Fix. If a matching login already exists, the user and login are mapped and password is ignored. If a matching login does not exist, sp_change_users_login creates a new SQL Server login and assigns password as the password for the new login. password is sysname, with a default of NULL.
Return Code Values

0 (success) or 1 (failure)
Result Sets
Column name 	Data type 	Description

Remarks

Use this procedure to link the security account for a user in the current database with a login. If the login for a user has changed, use sp_change_users_login to link the user to the new login without losing the user's permissions.

sp_change_users_login can be used only for SQL Server logins; it cannot be used with Windows logins.

login cannot be sa, and user cannot be the dbo, guest, or INFORMATION_SCHEMA users.

sp_change_users_login cannot be executed within a user-defined transaction.
Permissions

Any member of the public role can execute sp_change_users_login with the Report option. Only members of the sysadmin fixed server role can specify the Auto_Fix option. Only members of the sysadmin or db_owner roles can specify the Update_One option.
Examples
A. Show a report of the current user to login mappings

This example produces a report of the users in the current database and their security identifiers.

EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Report'

B. Change the login for a user

This example changes the link between user Mary in the pubs database and the existing login, to the new login NewMary (added with sp_addlogin).

--Add the new login.
USE master
go
EXEC sp_addlogin 'NewMary'
go

--Change the user account to link with the 'NewMary' login.
USE pubs
go
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Update_One', 'Mary', 'NewMary'

C. Automatically map a user to a login, creating a new login if necessary

This example shows how to use the Auto_Fix option to map an existing user to a login with the same name, or create the SQL Server login Mary with the password B3r12-36 if the login Mary does not exist.

USE pubs
go
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Auto_Fix', 'Mary', NULL, 'B3r12-36'
go
